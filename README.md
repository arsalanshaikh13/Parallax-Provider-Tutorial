## Overview

I modularized a previously monolithic `ci.yml` into:

- **Reusable workflows** (in `.github/workflows`) for build/test/publish stages.
- **Composite actions** (in `.github/actions/*/action.yml`) for shared logic
  (e.g., Node setup + caching).
- **Dynamic control** via inputs/outputs to selectively run jobs based on
  changed files and pipeline parameters.
- **Secure secret & permission flow**: Explicit passing from caller → reusable
  workflow → composite actions, with minimal required permissions for write
  operations.
- **Performance optimizations**: Switched from Yarn cache to `node_modules`
  caching; tuned fetch depth; strict artifact sharing between jobs.
- **Developer feedback**: Automatic **Jest coverage report** posted to Job
  Summary & Pull Requests.

## Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Monolithic GitHub Actions workflow became a bottleneck as the
project expanded:

- pipeline runs for simple documentation changes
- No test coverage visibility during code review
- Difficult to maintain and debug single 100+ line YAML file
- Cache inefficiencies causing unnecessary dependency reinstalls

**Impact**: Slower development velocity, poor maintainability, frustrating
developing experience

## Goals

- Scalability & maintainability via **modular pipeline** (small, focused files).
- Deterministic runs, **reproducible environments**, and explicit communication
  and permissions between workflows and jobs.
- Faster pipelines via **effective caching** and more control via change
  detection.
- Better developer UX: **coverage surfaced on PRs**, artifacts shared, and
  strict **status checks** gating merges.

## What I Implemented

**Core Strategy**: Modular pipeline design with intelligent execution control
with following features:

- **Modularization**: Split monolith into reusable workflows + composite
  actions.
- **Inter-pipeline Communication**: Parent workflow passes **inputs & secrets**
  to reusable workflows; those forward inputs to composite actions. Steps emit
  outputs `steps.<step-id>.outputs.*`→ jobs `jobs.<job>.outputs.*`→ workflow
  output is executed in parent via `needs.<job>.outputs.*`.
- **Selective Execution**: Trigger jobs only when relevant files change (custom
  `git diff` + regex).
- **Caching**: Cache **`node_modules`** instead of Yarn global cache using
  action `actions/cache@v4` .
- **Coverage Reporting**: `artiomTr/jest-coverage-action@v2` (requires write
  permissions for `checks`, `pull-requests`, and `contents`).
- **Branch Protections**: Require **lint_test_and_build** status to pass before
  merging.

**Key Components:**

| Component                | Purpose                                                                                                             | Benefit                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Parent Workflows**     | Orchestrates execution and change detection of relevant files                                                       | Run workflows on relevant file changes    |
| **Reusable Workflows**   | Clean separation of concerns; isolated, testable pipeline stages                                                    | Consistent and easier reuse across repos  |
| **Composite Actions**    | Share repeatable step blocks (e.g., checkout, Node setup, cache storing/retrieving, test, build, artifact handling) | Reduced duplication                       |
| **Explicit Permissions** | Required permission declaration at each workflow level                                                              | Security compliance                       |
| **Artifact Sharing**     | Controlled data flow between jobs                                                                                   | Deterministic builds                      |
| **node_modules caching** | Faster and controlled dependency flows between workflows; avoid linking dependencies in each workflow               | Deterministic restoration of dependencies |

### Architecture Decisions

- **Why explicit secrets?** Reusable workflows **do not inherit**
  secrets/permissions; explicit flow is more secure and predictable.
- **Why `node_modules` cache?** Smaller, more deterministic restoration across
  jobs than Yarn’s global cache for this project’s shape as yarn cache still
  requires dependencies install to match yarn packages with specific node
  version.

#### Why Modular Over Monolithic?

- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and modify individual components
- **Reusability**: Shared logic across multiple repositories
- **Testing**: Isolated workflows can be tested independently
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different pipeline
  aspects

#### Why Change Detection Over Always-Run?

- **Cost efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary compute on documentation changes
- **Developer experience**: Faster feedback for non-critical changes
- **Resource optimization**: Better runner utilization

## Root Cause Analysis of Key Issues

| Problem                                                                                               | Root Cause                                                                                                                 | Solution                                                                                                                                     | Impact                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Composite action couldn’t access secrets**                                                          | Composite actions **never inherit** `secrets` or `env`, even within same repo                                              | Pass secrets **explicitly** as action inputs; forward them from caller → reusable workflow → action                                          | Secure & predictable secret flow                |

## Technical key features implementation

### Change Detection

**Problem**:

- native changes keyword doesn't work on rollbacks, resets, forced pushes

**Solution**:

```yaml

# Efficient file-based job triggering
detect_changes:

   - uses: actions/checkout@v4
     with:
       fetch-depth: 2 # fetching last 2 commits

  - steps:
      - name: Check for relevant changes
        run: |
          changed_files=$(git diff --name-only  HEAD^ ${{ github.sha }} 2>&1 | grep -E '\.js$|\.json$|\.yml$|\.lock$|\..*rc$')
          echo $changed_files output
          if [ -n "$changed_files" ]; then
            echo "Relevant files have been changed."
            echo "has_changes=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "No relevant files were changed. Skipping subsequent jobs."
            echo "has_changes=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
```

**Why this works**: Explicit git diff calculation handles rollback and resets
and forced pushes very well.

### Optimized Caching Strategy

**Problem**: Yarn cache was:

- Large (~110MB)
- still needed to install dependencies to match to specific node version
- Frequently invalidated

**Solution**:

````yaml
# Strategic node_modules caching
- name: Get node_modules
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    id: node_modules
    with:
      path: |
        **/node_modules
      # hashing yarn.lock to freeze package dependencies version and checking for those specific verison only
      # Adding node version as cache key
      key:
        ${{ runner.os }}-node_modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock')
        }}-v18.20.8```
````

**Why this works**: Direct `node_modules` caching eliminates package resolution
overhead compared to global package caches and deterministic dependencies are
transferred across jobs.

### Jest Coverage reporting on PR and Job summary

**Problem**:

- test coverage was only locally available for review
- needed to scan jobs log to see the test coverage.

**Solution**:

```yaml
- name: Jest Coverage Comment
    id: coverage
    uses: ArtiomTr/jest-coverage-report-action@v2
    with:
      github-token: ${{ inputs.secret_input_github_token }}
      annotations: all # show all the errors
      skip-step: all # just utilize the test coverage instead of running test here
      coverage-file: ${{github.workspace}}/coverage/report.json
      base-coverage-file: ${{github.workspace}}/coverage/report.json
      output: comment, report-markdown
      icons: emoji

- name: Check the output coverage
      run: |
        echo "TEST RESULTS:" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
        echo "" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
        cat <<EOF >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
        ${{ steps.coverage.outputs.report }}
        EOF
      shell: bash
      if: always() # show the error reporting as well

```

**Why this works**: it just takes the test coverage generated during test and
organized and beautifies and transforms into usable markdown format to be shown
on Pull Request and Job summary

## Debug Checklist / Commands

- Confirm permissions at top level (caller):
  `permissions: { contents: write, checks: write, pull-requests: write }`
- Verify secrets are passed explicitly in `uses: ./.github/workflows/...` via
  `secrets:` and forwarded to composite actions as **inputs**.
- Ensure diff is correct:

  ```
  git --version
  git rev-parse ${{ github.sha }}
  git rev-parse HEAD^
  git diff --name-only  HEAD^ ${{ github.sha }}
  ```

- Cache keys: print them to logs to compare:

  ```
  echo "${{ runner.os }}-node-provider-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}"
  ```

- Artifact sanity:

  ```
  ls -la dist coverage
  ```

## Best Practices & Recommendations

- **Folder rules**
  - Reusable workflows **must** live in `.github/workflows`.
  - Composite actions live in `.github/actions/<name>/action.yml` (or a
    dedicated repo—**one action per repo** when published).

- **Always call modular parts with `uses:`**; keep business logic out of the
  driver file.
- **Secrets & permissions**
  - Reusable workflows **do not inherit** secrets/permissions; define them in
    the **caller**.
  - Composite actions **never** see `secrets` implicitly—pass them as inputs.

- **Outputs plumbing**
  - Step `echo "output=<something>">> $GITHUB_OUTPUT` → Job
    (`outputs:steps.<step-id>.outputs.*`) → Reusable workflow
    (`outputs:jobs.<job>.outputs.*`) → Parent (`needs.<job>.outputs.*`).

- **Status checks**
  - Protect `main`: require **Test CI** to pass before merging PRs.

- **Performance**
  - Prefer `node_modules` cache for this repo over Yarn global cache.
  - Keep `fetch-depth: 2` for robust diffs for repeated rollbacks .

- **Artifacts**
  - Use `upload-artifact` / `download-artifact` to avoid rebuilding between
    jobs.
- **Cache key**
  - Use `cache key` to successfully and securely save and retrive the caches for
    node modules and yarn packages and since the hash key is based on yarn.lock
    file check for changes in the dependencies between the builds
- **Resetting tags for rollbacks**
  - after deleting the tag, always reset hard to previous commit and then force
    push previous commit, then create the new commit+tag using npm version patch
    and then successfully push the same tag again, this way we can push tags
    with just fetching previous 2 commits only instead of fetching full git
    history

---

## Results of the Fixes

- **Pipeline runtime** significantly reduced across stages.
- **Cache footprint** dropped from \~110MB (Yarn) to \~17MB (`node_modules`).
- **PR feedback loop** improved by showing coverage in both **Job Summary** and
  **PR**.
- **Maintainability**: A clean, modular layout makes it easy to evolve the
  pipeline.

### Key insights on Some key issues

1. **Permission Inheritance Problems**:
   - **Fundamental Understanding**: GitHub Actions has strict permission
     isolation between workflow components
   - **Core Insight**: Reusable workflows don't inherit permissions from
     parents; composites don't inherit secrets
   - **Solution Pattern**: Explicit permission declaration at each reusable
     workflow

2. **Cache Optimization**:
   - **Deep Analysis**: Yarn's global cache is a much bigger file still requires
     installing and linking dependencies to match cache with specific node
     version
   - **Performance Truth**: node_modules caching provides more deterministic
     restoration in further pipeline runs
   - **Architecture Impact**: Cache strategy affects both performance and
     reliability

3. **Change Detection Reliability for tag push**:
   - **Git Complexity**: Shallow clones and merge base calculation are
     notoriously tricky in CI environments especially for rollbacks for tags
   - **Solution Strength**: keep fetch-depth 2 to compare parent commit with
     current commit using git diff, in case of rollbacks first force push the
     previous commit, then push the new commit which has the tag version in it

4. **Secrets Inheritance Problems in composite actions**:
   - **Behavior**: Composite actions don't inherit secrets context
   - **Reason**: composite actions are meant to be reused across multiple
     repositories which makes secrets inheritance management complicated
   - **Solution**: pass the secrets as input variable

## Lessons Learned

1. **Modularize early**: Reusable workflows + composite actions keep CI easy to
   reason about.
2. **Be explicit with secrets/permissions**: GitHub Actions won’t implicitly
   pass them to reusables/composites.
3. **Measure, then optimize**: Switching to `node_modules` cache provided real
   speed + size wins here.
4. **Surface developer feedback**: Coverage in PRs changes behavior—developers
   respond to what they can see.
5. **Guard the mainline**: Required status checks protect release quality with
   minimal friction.

**Tech Stack**: GitHub Actions, Node.js, git, YAML, Shell Scripting  
**Skills Demonstrated**: DevOps Architecture, Performance Optimization,
Developer Experience

> **Why This Matters**  
> This solution demonstrates advanced platform mastery by solving GitHub
> Actions' most complex challenges: permission isolation, cache optimization,
> and reliable change detection. The focus on **security**, **performance**, and
> **maintainability** shows production-grade thinking that delivers measurable
> business value.
