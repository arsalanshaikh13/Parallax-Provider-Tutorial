Perfect! Let’s dive into **Part 3: Jest Coverage Reports & Job Summaries**. This
is where your CI/CD pipeline starts “talking” to developers, not just
machines—making your work visible, actionable, and impressive for a portfolio
blog.

# 📊 Part 3: Supercharging Feedback with Jest Coverage Reports & Job Summaries

### TL;DR

- **Jest coverage reports on PRs** give instant visibility into code quality.
- **Job Summaries** turn raw workflow logs into readable insights.
- Together, they **speed reviews**, **catch bugs early**, and make your pipeline
  a developer-friendly tool.

---

## 👀 Why Developer Feedback Matters

Imagine this scenario:

- You submit a PR.
- The pipeline runs silently.
- Reviewers have no idea if your changes maintain test coverage.

Result? Frustration, slower merges, and accidental regressions.

By surfacing test coverage and summaries **directly in the PR**, your pipeline
becomes a **real-time collaborator**, not just a background job.

## 🛠 Setting Up Jest Coverage Reporting

### Step 1: Generate coverage JSON

```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    npm ci
    npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=json
```

- `--coverageReporters=json` generates a `coverage/report.json` file.

### Step 2: Comment coverage on PR

```yaml
- name: Jest Coverage Comment
  uses: ArtiomTr/jest-coverage-report-action@v2
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    coverage-file: coverage/report.json
    output: comment, report-markdown
    icons: emoji
```

✅ Now your PR shows a **beautiful, readable coverage report**.

---

## 📝 Adding Job Summaries

Job summaries help **organize logs** and highlight key insights.

```yaml
- name: Write Job Summary
  run: |
    echo "## Test Coverage Report" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    cat coverage/report.json >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

- `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` creates a **markdown summary** visible on the workflow
  run page.
- Makes debugging **much easier**, especially when multiple jobs run
  sequentially.

---

## 🔄 Combining Coverage + Artifacts

If your pipeline has **multiple jobs**, combine coverage with artifacts:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: coverage-json
    path: coverage/report.json

# Later job
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: coverage-json
```

- Ensures all jobs **read the same coverage data**, no discrepancies.
- Enables **centralized reporting** even when tests run in parallel.
