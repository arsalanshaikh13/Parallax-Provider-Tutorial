# üß© How I Built a Modular GitHub Actions Pipeline (Part 1: Architecture)

### TL;DR

If your GitHub Actions workflow is a **150-line YAML monster** that tries to do
everything in one place‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not alone. In this guide, I‚Äôll show you how to
split it into **modular pieces**‚Äîparent workflows, reusable workflows, and
composite actions‚Äîso your CI/CD feels more like Lego blocks than spaghetti code.

---

## üí° Why Modular Workflows Matter

Think of your CI/CD pipeline like building a house.

- A **monolithic workflow** is like trying to pour the foundation, install
  plumbing, paint the walls, and decorate‚Äîall in one step. Messy, error-prone,
  hard to debug.
- A **modular workflow** is like having contractors: one team lays the
  foundation, another handles wiring, another paints. Each does their job, and
  the architect (parent workflow) orchestrates it all.

Benefits:

- **Maintainability** ‚Üí fix one piece without breaking the others.
- **Reusability** ‚Üí share common steps across projects.
- **Scalability** ‚Üí add new features (like coverage reports or artifact
  handling) without rewriting your CI from scratch.

#### Folder Layout

```
- .github
  - actions                       # contains all the composite actions
    - publish
      - action.yml
    - test_and_build
      - action.yml
  - workflows                     # contains all the reusable workflow that uses actions
    - ci.yml                      # parent caller workflow that uses reusable workflows
    - filter-changes.yml
    - publish.yml
    - test_and_build.yml
```

## üèóÔ∏è Parent Workflow: The Orchestrator

The **parent workflow** is your conductor‚Äîit decides when and how the
‚Äúinstruments‚Äù (child workflows) play.

Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# A friendly, descriptive name for the workflow.
name: Build, Test and Publish

# Defines when the workflow will run.
on:
  # The 'pull_request' event triggers the workflow whenever a pull request is opened or updated on the 'main' branch.
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  # The 'push' event triggers the workflow when code is pushed to the 'main' branch or when a new version tag is pushed.
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# This is where the workflow's jobs are defined.
jobs:
  # This job checks for relevant code changes to avoid unnecessary runs on non-code changes.
  filter-changes:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/filter-changes.yml

  # This job runs tests and builds the project.
  test-and-build:
    # Grants necessary permissions for the test_and_build job to write on test coverage on Pull request as per artiomTr/ documenation.
    # https://github.com/ArtiomTr/jest-coverage-report-action?tab=readme-ov-file#pull-request-number
    permissions:
      checks: write
      pull-requests: write
      contents: write
    # The 'needs' keyword ensures this job only runs after the 'filter-changes' job is complete.
    needs: filter-changes
    # This 'if' condition checks the output from the previous job to determine if this job should run.
    if: needs.filter-changes.outputs.has_relevant_changes == 'true'
    # Reuses a separate workflow file for the test and build logic.
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test_and_build.yml
    # passing the secrets into reusable workflow
    secrets:
      secret_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

üîç What‚Äôs happening here?

- The parent workflow runs a **filter-changes** job.
- If relevant files changes then filter-changes output is true which allows now
  to run the `test-and-build` job.
- If relevant files have not changed filter-changes output is false, so all the
  test_and_build job is skipped.
- we will talk about
- secrets is being passed to test_and_build job under secrets key
- permissions grant the write permission for checks, pull-requests and contents
  in order to publish jest coverage on Pull request

---

## üîÅ Reusable Workflows

A **reusable workflow** is basically a packaged pipeline you can call from
multiple repos or multiple places in the same repo.

Example: the filter-change.yml file which has logic to detect changes to
relevant files

```yaml
# .github/workflows/filter-changes.yml
# A short and descriptive name for the workflow.
name: Filter Changes

# This allows the workflow to be called and reused by other workflows.
on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      # Defines a descriptive output to check if relevant files were changed.
      has_relevant_changes:
        description: 'Check whether relevant files changed'
        value: ${{ jobs.filter-changes.outputs.has_relevant_changes }}

# Defines the single job in this workflow.
jobs:
  filter-changes:
    # Specifies the type of runner the job will use.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      # Sets the output value for this job, which is the result from the 'check-changes' step.
      has_relevant_changes: ${{ steps.check-changes.outputs.has_changes }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        # Uses the 'actions/checkout' action to get a copy of the repository's code.
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Fetches the entire git history to enable a proper comparison of changes.
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Check for relevant file changes
        # Assigns an ID to this step so its output can be referenced later.
        id: check-changes
        run: |
          # The 'set +e' command prevents the script from exiting immediately if a command fails.
          set +e
          # Uses 'git diff' to find the names of files that have changed between the current and previous commit.
          # The output is piped to 'grep' to filter for specific file extensions like .js, .json, etc.
          changed_files=$(git diff --name-only  HEAD^ ${{ github.sha }} 2>&1 | grep -E '\.js$|\.json$|\.yml$|\.lock$|\..*rc$')
          echo $changed_files output
          # An 'if' condition checks if the 'changed_files' variable is not empty.
          if [ -n "$changed_files" ]; then
            echo "Relevant files have been changed."
            # Sets the 'has_changes' output to 'true' if changes are found.
            echo "has_changes=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "No relevant files were changed. Skipping subsequent jobs."
            # Sets the 'has_changes' output to 'false' if no relevant changes are found.
            echo "has_changes=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
```

üîç What‚Äôs happening here?

- the 'git diff' command is used to find the names of files that have changed
  between the current and previous commit.
- The output is piped to 'grep' command to filter for specific file extensions
  like .js, .json,.yml,.lock etc. since these are the files which are relevant
  to my pipeline.

* why this works?

- the native changes keyword doesn't work well with forced commits

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test_and_build.yml
# A clear and descriptive name for the workflow.
name: Lint, Test, and Build

# This defines the workflow as a reusable workflow that can be called by other workflows.
on:
  workflow_call:
    # Specifies the secrets that must be passed in when this workflow is called.
    secrets:
      secret_GITHUB_TOKEN:
        required: true

# The jobs section defines the work that will be performed by the workflow.
jobs:
  test-and-build:
    # Specifies the runner environment where the job will execute.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        # Uses the 'actions/checkout' action to clone the repository's code into runner environment.
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup, install, lint, test and build code
        # This step calls a custom composite action located in the local repository.
        # This promotes code reuse and keeps the main workflow file clean.
        uses: ./.github/actions/test_and_build
        with:
          # Passes the required secret to the reusable action.
          secret_input_github_token: ${{secrets.secret_GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

üîç What‚Äôs happening here?

- `workflow_call:` keyword defines the workflow as a reusable workflow it is
  necessary to write this keyword in every reusable workflow,
- is running Now the parent can simply say:

```yaml
uses: ./.github/workflows/filter-changes.yml
uses: ./.github/workflows/test_and_build.yml
secrets:
  secret_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

and you‚Äôre good to go üéâ.

Why it matters:

- You define the steps **once**.
- Any repo/project can reuse it.
- Perfect for teams with multiple services following the same build/test
  patterns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Composite Actions

While reusable workflows group entire pipelines, **composite actions** group
**repeated steps** into a single action.

Example:

```yaml
# .github/actions/test_and_build/action.yml
# A clear name for the reusable workflow.
name: Lint, Test and Build

# Defines the inputs that this reusable workflow accepts.
inputs:
  secret_input_github_token:
    required: true

# Specifies that this is a composite run action, which combines multiple steps into a single reusable action.
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    # This step checks for a cached 'node_modules' directory to speed up the workflow.
    - name: Get node_modules
      # The 'actions/cache' action handles caching and restoring files.
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      id: node_modules
      with:
        # The path to the directory that will be cached.
        path: |
          **/node_modules
        # The cache key is generated from the runner's OS, a fixed string, and a hash of the 'yarn.lock' file.
        # This ensures the cache is unique to the dependencies and the runner environment.
        key:
          ${{ runner.os }}-node_modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock')
          }}-v18.20.8

    # This step only runs if the cache was not found in the previous step.
    - name: Setup Node.js
      if: steps.node_modules.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
      # Uses the 'actions/setup-node' action to set up the specified Node.js version.
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 18.20.8

    # This step installs the project dependencies using yarn.
    # It also only runs if the cache was not found, as there's no need to install if the cache is restored.
    - name: Install dependencies
      if: steps.node_modules.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
      run: yarn install  --frozen-lockfile
      shell: bash

    # This step runs the linting check for the code.
    - name: Lint
      run: yarn lint
      shell: bash

    # This step runs the unit tests for the project.
    - name: Test
      run: yarn test
      shell: bash

    # This step runs the build command to create the distributable files.
    - name: Build
      run: yarn build
      shell: bash

    # This action generates a code coverage report and adds it as a comment on the pull request.
    - name: Jest Coverage Comment
      id: coverage
      uses: ArtiomTr/jest-coverage-report-action@v2
      with:
        # Passes the GitHub token to the action for authentication.
        github-token: ${{ inputs.secret_input_github_token }}
        # Specifies that annotations for coverage should be added to all files.
        annotations: all
        # Skips the default install and test steps of this action, as they've already been run.
        skip-step: all
        # Specifies the paths to the Jest coverage files.
        coverage-file: ${{github.workspace}}/coverage/report.json
        base-coverage-file: ${{github.workspace}}/coverage/report.json
        # Defines the output format for the coverage report.
        output: comment, report-markdown
        # Use emojis for the report icons.
        icons: emoji

    # This step adds the coverage report to the job summary for easy viewing in the Actions UI.
    - name: Check the output coverage
      run: |
        echo "TEST RESULTS:" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
        echo "" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
        # The 'cat' command is used with a here-doc to write the report content to the summary.
        cat <<EOF >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
        ${{ steps.coverage.outputs.report }}
        EOF
      shell: bash
      # Ensures this step runs even if previous steps fail, so you always get the summary.
      if: always()

    # This step uploads the build artifacts (the 'dist' folder) so they can be downloaded and used by other jobs.
    - name: Upload build artifacts (dist/)
      # Uses the 'actions/upload-artifact' action for uploading.
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        # Defines the name of the artifact, which will be the name of the zip file.
        name: dist
        # Specifies the path to the files that should be uploaded.
        path: dist/**
        # The workflow will fail if no files are found to upload.
        if-no-files-found: error
        # Sets a retention period for how long the artifact should be kept.
        retention-days: 1 day
```

Usage in workflows:

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/test_and_build
```

Why it matters:

- DRY (don‚Äôt repeat yourself).
- Cleaner workflows (less YAML duplication).
- Easier upgrades‚Äîupdate one composite action, and every workflow using it gets
  the fix.

## üß≠ Tradeoffs: Reusable vs Composite

| Feature        | Reusable Workflow | Composite Action      |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Scope          | Whole jobs        | Steps only            |
| Inputs/Outputs | Supports          | Limited               |
| Best For       | Entire pipelines  | Repeated setup/config |

üëâ Pro tip: use **reusable workflows** for big picture (build/test/deploy) and
**composite actions** for boilerplate steps (setup/cache).
