## Overview

### Purpose

This implementation guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing a
modular GitLab CI/CD pipeline architecture that conditionally executes jobs
based on specific changed files. The solution addresses reliability issues with
GitLab's native features and solutions to workaround those issues.

### Scope

This guide covers:

- Modular template system for reusable CI/CD components
- Dynamic parent/child pipeline architecture for conditional execution
- Runtime changed file detection that works across all GitLab pipeline trigger
  scenarios
- Performance optimization through lightweight images, artifacts management and
  smart caching

### Achieved Outcome

This GitLab CI/CD pipeline system :

- Maintains modular, reusable pipeline components
- Executes only relevant jobs based on changed files
- Provides 100% reliable detection of changed files across all trigger methods
- Reduces pipeline execution time by 25-72%

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- Basic understanding of GitLab CI/CD concepts (stages, jobs, artifacts)
- Familiarity with YAML syntax and structure
- Basic shell scripting knowledge
- Git workflow understanding (commits, branches, diffs)

## The Problem: When GitLab CI/CD Features Break Down

### Initial State: large monolithic file

```yaml
# the naive fragile approach
image: ubuntu:latest
stages: [lint_and_test, build, publish]
---

---

---
100+ lines of code
```

### Pain Points Discovered

**Unreliable Change Detection:**

- **Problem:** Native `rules:changes` failed to detect changes in relevant files
- **Root Cause** `rules:changes` internal mechanism is based on git diff between
  previous commit i.e. `CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA`, and current commit i.e.
  `CI_COMMIT_SHA`.
  - Gitlab sets `CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA` to all zeros on pipeline triggered
    manually i.e. through api or trigger, which failes git diff and thus
    `rules:changes`

**Resource Waste:**

- **Heavy base images**: Ubuntu (800MB) for every job, even simple shell scripts
- **Full pipeline execution**: Every commit triggered all the jobs, regardless
  of which files changed
- **Inefficient artifact handling**: Jobs were downloading unnecessary build
  artifacts, adding more time per job

**Maintenance Nightmare:**

- Repetitive conditional logic scattered across dozens of jobs
- A single 100+ line `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that was becoming unmaintainable
- Difficulty debugging which jobs should run for specific changes
- No clear separation between decision logic and execution

#### Key snippets to make modular template system

**Caller workflow**

Call the other jobs using `include` keyword

- define the anchor in caller workflow
- define the stages in caller workflow
- can write job specific code in the caller workflow as well
- job specific code mentioned in the caller workflow will take precedence and
  override the similar job code mentioned in the template

* Note: the code snippet below is of one of the child pipeline which i am going
  to discuss in the next section regarding parent/child pipelines

```yml
# .gitlab/child-pipepline/ci-full.yml
# set the base docker image to use for all jobs
# can define docker image to use of individual jobs in their own template
image: node:18-alpine

# include keyword is required to use the job templates stored in other files
include:
  project: 'arsalanshaikh13/Parallax-Provider-Tutorial' # your gitlab_username/Project_name
  ref: gitlabci # branch name in your project
  file: # files to include
    - '.gitlab/lint_and_test/lint_and_test.yml'
    - '.gitlab/build/build.yml'
    - '.gitlab/release/release.yml'

# can set anchors only in the caller workflow
.cache_common: &cache_common
  key:
    files:
      - yarn.lock
  paths:
    - node_modules/
# stages must be set in the caller workflow
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - release
# using the anchors set above
# can write job specific code in the caller workflow as well
lint_and_test:
  cache:
    <<: *cache_common
```

**Individual job templates**

- Write the jobs code as you would write in the single yml file for any jobs
- The `stage` set under `stages` keyword in the caller workflow should match the
  `stage` set in the job

```yml
# '.gitlab/build/build.yml'
build:
  stage: build
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "parent_pipeline"'
      when: on_success
    - when: never
  before_script:
    - yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
  script:
    - yarn build
```

#### Why Modular Workflows Matter

**Problems with Monolithic CI/CD Architecture:**

- **Scalability Limitations** A single, large pipeline grows increasingly
  complex and slow as the project scales, becoming harder to manage and
  optimize.
- **Slower and cumbersome lookups of jobs** Need to scan through many unrelated
  jobs to identify relevant job code, to modify and monitor code, consuming
  developing time on search.
- **Difficult Debugging and Monitoring** Failures are buried in large pipelines,
  making it hard to isolate and trace errors back to specific components or
  jobs.
- **Poor Maintainability** update or refactoring job codes and definition is
  difficult without affecting unrelated jobs so more probability and frequency
  of mistakes
- **Higher Risk of Human Error** Complex and repetitive logic (e.g., conditional
  checks) increases the chance of misconfiguration and oversight.
- **Redundant modification** Logic and job definitions are often duplicated
  across different jobs, instead of reuse, leading to problem of changing code
  at many places where there is duplication.
- **Reduced Team Autonomy** Teams working on different parts of the codebase are
  forced to coordinate changes in a single shared pipeline file.

**How Modular Architecture Solves These Issues:**

- **Improved development and Scalability** Pipelines are broken into smaller,
  manageable templates , allowing them to monitor, develop and scale
  independently.
- **Easier Debugging** Failures are localized within specific modules, making
  troubleshooting faster and more precise.
- **Enhanced Maintainability** Smaller pipeline files are easier to modify,
  extend, and review without affecting unrelated workflows.
- **Faster lookup and Feedback** go to specific template without scanning the
  whole the monolithic file which enable parallel or scoped development and
  execution, giving quicker results on their changes.
- **Reduced Duplication** Shared pipelines, templates promote reuse,
  consistency, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- **Independent management** Different pipelines, templates can be managed
  independently at different locations anc can be used at any location fostering
  better collaboration and parallel development.
- **More flexibility to develop strategy for Workflows** Modular setups allow
  conditional triggering, job grouping, and custom workflows that adapt to
  project complexity provide more flexibility to develop better strategy for
  running workflows

### Dynamic parent/child pipeline architecture for conditional execution

**Problems:**

- The full pipeline is triggered for any changed file, even when not required.
- Repetitive conditional checks must be written in each job to ensure it runs
  only for relevant changed files.
- This approach is:
  - **Cumbersome** to implement and maintain.
  - **Difficult and more error-prone to track and debug**, especially as the
    pipeline scales and becomes more complex and easier to lose track of changes
    made to other jobs.
  - **Slower to evaluate**, we have to lookup through all the jobs to debug and
    make any changes to the any job.
  - **Repetitive and Redundant evaluation**: The same conditional checks are
    repeated across multiple jobs, increasing the risk of human error and
    reducing maintainability.
  - **Difficult to scale**: As the number of files and jobs grows, the overhead
    of maintaining per-job conditions and evaluating them increases
    disproportionately.
  - **Wasted CI minutes** Sometimes Developers must wait for the entire pipeline
    to complete only to find out pipeline ran for non relevant changed files,
    reducing development speed .

**Root Causes:**

- **Monolithic pipeline structure**: All jobs are visible and potentially
  triggered for any changed file, regardless of relevance.
- **Lack of job grouping**: There's no logical grouping of jobs to map changed
  files to affected jobs
- **Decentralized selection logic**: Each job contains its own conditional
  logic, leading to duplication and inconsistency across the pipeline.
- **non deterministic feedback**: the pipeline didn't provide reliable
  information about which changed file triggered the pipeline

**Solution Implementation**:

- group all the relevant jobs together in full pipeline
- when relevant files changed, run the full pipeline whichs make the grouped
  jobs visible and executes them
- when no relevant files changed, run empty pipeline with skip job

Parent Pipeline code snippet:

```yml
# docker image to use for all jobs
image: alpine:latest

# set workflow rules for all the stages, exit the workflow if rules don't match
workflow:
  rules:
    # run pipeline on branch push, tag push and only through trigger source
    # and avoid double pipeline trigger one through api source and other through gitlab username source
    - if:
        '($CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "gitlabci" || $CI_COMMIT_TAG) &&
        $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "trigger"'
    - when: never # do not run pipeline on any other condition

stages:
  - check
  - trigger

# This job explicitly checks for file changes and fails if none found
check_for_relevant_files:
  stage: check
  before_script: |
    apk add --no-cache git # since we are using git command in the script so install git here
    chmod +x .gitlab/generate-pipeline.sh

  script:
    - sh .gitlab/generate-pipeline.sh
  # using artifacts to pass generated file to the subsequent job
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - .gitlab/pipeline-config.yml
    expire_in: 10 minutes

trigger_child_pipeline:
  stage: trigger
  trigger: # trigger keyword generates child pipeline
    include:
      - artifact: .gitlab/pipeline-config.yml
        job: check_for_relevant_files
    strategy: depend
```

Child pipeline -> skip job code snippet : (the full pipeline code was discussed
in previous section of modular architecture)

```yml
#.gitlab/child-pipeline/ci-empty.yml
image: busybox:latest
stages:
  - skip

skip_job:
  stage: skip
  script:
    - echo "No relevant changes — skipping downstream jobs."
```

#### How this Parent / Child pipeline Works

1. **Global image** The pipeline sets a single default runtime (`alpine:latest`)
   so every job runs in the same lightweight environment (jobs may still
   override this). This keeps job footprints small and makes `apk` available for
   quick installs.

2. **Top-level workflow rules (gatekeeper)** `workflow.rules` restricts when the
   whole pipeline can be created: only on a push to the `gitlabci` branch **or**
   a tag **and** when the pipeline source is `trigger`. Any other condition is
   explicitly denied (`when: never`). This prevents accidental/double runs and
   ensures only intended trigger events create a pipeline.

3. **Stage ordering: `check` → `trigger`** Two stages enforce the sequence:
   first detect whether a full pipeline is needed (`check`), then conditionally
   launch the child pipeline (`trigger`). This guarantees the detection step
   always runs before the child pipeline decision is made.

4. **`check_for_relevant_files` job (detection + artifact)**
   - **before_script**: installs `git` and makes the detection script executable
     so the job can run repository-level `git` commands.
   - **script**: runs a repo-side script (e.g., `generate-pipeline.sh`) that
     inspects commits and writes a `.gitlab/pipeline-config.yml` pointing to
     either a full or empty child pipeline.
   - **artifacts**: the generated `pipeline-config.yml` is persisted as an
     artifact and passed to the next job; `expire_in: 10 minutes` limits storage
     lifetime.

5. **`trigger_child_pipeline` job (child pipeline creation)** This job uses
   GitLab’s `trigger` keyword with an `include` that references the artifact
   produced by the `check_for_relevant_files` job. GitLab reads that included
   YAML and creates the child pipeline accordingly. `strategy: depend` makes the
   parent pipeline wait for the child and propagate the child pipeline’s
   success/failure status back to the parent.

6. **Runtime flow (what actually happens)**
   - Pipeline is created only when workflow rules match.
   - The `check` job runs the detection script and emits a `pipeline-config.yml`
     that selects `ci-empty.yml` or `ci-full.yml`.
   - The `trigger` job reads that artifact and triggers the child pipeline that
     contains the real jobs.
   - Parent waits for child (because of `strategy: depend`) and succeeds/fails
     based on the child result.

**notes**

- All referenced child pipeline files (`ci-full.yml`, `ci-empty.yml`) and the
  detection script must be committed to the repository.
- `expire_in` must be long enough for the trigger job to run in case of
  scheduling/delays.
- Because the base image is Alpine, the job installs `git` at runtime—if your
  runner environment already provides `git`, you can skip that step to speed up
  jobs.

**Why This Solution Works**:

- **Clean separation of concerns**: Decision logic isolated from execution logic
  as parent pipeline handles the selection of jobs based on relevant changed
  files, child pipeline handles the execution of the jobs
- **Centralization of selection logic**: one job handles conditional check and
  no requirement of repetitively writing conditional checks on each job
- **Better job visibility:** relevant jobs are visible on relevant changed files
- **Runtime conditional checks**: detect at runtime whether work is required,
  then dynamically include and run only the appropriate child pipeline.
- **deterministic feedback**: relevant pipelines are triggered for relevant
  changed files.

**Benefits of the solution**

- **Optimized Resource Utilization** Triggering only relevant jobs based on
  specific file changes reduces unnecessary execution, saving compute resources
  and time.
- **Improved Troubleshooting and Monitoring** Clear mapping between changed
  files and affected jobs help in Running targeted jobs which enhances
  visibility into failures and job status, facilitating faster feedback and more
  effective debugging.
- **Enhanced Scalability for Growing Codebases** Logical grouping and
  modularization of jobs allow the pipeline to handle increasing files and
  complexity without performance degradation.
- **Minimized Risk of Errors** Removing decentralized repetitive conditional
  checks simplifies job configurations, making them easier to read, maintain,
  and update and lowers the chance of human error
- **Easier Long-Term Maintenance** Modular and structured pipelines simplify
  refactoring, updates, and onboarding as the project evolves.
- **Improved Developer Productivity** Less time spent writing and managing
  conditional logic lets developers focus on core development and innovation.

### Runtime detection for relevant files that works across all GitLab trigger scenarios

**Problem**: Pipeline triggered on changes to any files

**Root Cause**: Native `rules:changes` failed to detect changes in relevant
files

**Solution Implementation**:

- using git diff to detect changed file
- pass CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA variable value i.e. parent (previous) commit, as
  trigger payload with API request

```bash
# stop and exit the script when error occured
set -e
# compare parent (previous) commit with current commit and produces name of files only and pipe output to grep to match for file extensions
# store the output of grep into $CHANGED either file name(when match found) or empty string (when match not found)
CHANGED=$(git diff --pretty="" --name-only "$CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA" "$CI_COMMIT_SHA" 2>&1  | grep -E '\.js$|\.json$|\.yml$|\.lock$|\.sh$|\..*rc$' )

echo "output of diff: $CHANGED "
# checks whether $CHANGED is empty or not and based on that execute the relevant code
if [ -z "$CHANGED" ]; then
    echo "No relevant changes found. Generating empty pipeline."
    cat  > .gitlab/pipeline-config.yml <<EOF
include:
  - local: '.gitlab/child-pipeline/ci-empty.yml'
EOF
else
    echo "Found relevant changes: $CHANGED"
    cat > .gitlab/pipeline-config.yml <<EOF
include:
  - local: '.gitlab/child-pipeline/ci-full.yml'
EOF
fi
```

#### How the Runtime Detection Script Works

The script acts as a **gatekeeper** — detecting whether a change really matters,
and deciding between a **empty skip** or a **full** pipeline.

1. **Look at what changed** It compares the current commit against the previous
   one and collects the list of files that were modified.

2. **Filter out the noise** Only changes in relevant file types are considered —
   things like `.js`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.sh`, or dotfiles. Non relevant changes
   (e.g., docs) won’t count.

3. **Run empty pipeline when relevant changes was not found** If no relevant
   files changed, it prints a friendly message and generates an “empty
   pipeline.” This saves time and resources.

4. **Run the full pipeline when it matters** If relevant files did change, it
   announces them and generates the configuration for a full pipeline run.

5. **Works in every trigger scenario** Because it’s based on comparing commit
   SHAs, this logic works consistently across pushes, merge requests, tags, API
   triggers, scheduled runs, and even force pushes or rollbacks.

**Why This Solution Works**:

- **Handles zero SHAs**: compares parent commit with current commit
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Never fails, always produces a decision
- **Custom filtering**: Precise control using grep and regex pattern over which
  files trigger

**Benefit**: 100% Reliable detection of relevant changed files with custom
script vs 0% reliability using native `rules:changes`

### Performance optimization through lightweight images, Artifacts management and smart caching

#### Lightweight node-alpine images vs Full-featured ubuntu base Images

**Problem**: Default base ubuntu images taking 20s to just load the images
**Cause**: Base ubuntu images are 800mb in size because having high amount of
tools built in

**Solution**: Most of the base ubuntu images features were not required by my
projects so i used `node-18:Alpine` Linux for most jobs, `alpine:latest` images
only when needed with needing to install only few tool like git, curl

**Benefit** 80% size reduction (800MB → 167MB) significantly improved pipeline
speed by 60%

#### Artifacts management

- **Problem:** `build` was pulling artifacts from `lint_and_test` even though
  not needed.
- **Cause:** Default artifact dependency behavior (or `needs:` without
  `artifacts: false`).
- **Solutions:**

  ```yml
  needs:
    - job: lint_and_test
      artifacts: false
  ```

- **Benefit:** 20% Faster execution of build job.

#### Setting cache policy

- **Problem:** time wasted in pushing(saving) the cache in many jobs

- **Cause:** all the jobs push (save) and pull (retrieve) cache by default

- **Solutions:** first job pushes (save) the cache and subsequent jobs just pull
  (retrieve) the cache

```yml
.cache_common: &cache_common
  key:
    files:
      - yarn.lock
  paths:
    - node_modules/

lint_and_test:
  cache:
    <<: *cache_common

build:
  cache:
    <<: *cache_common
    policy: pull
```

**Impact**: faster pipeline execution by removing redundant cache pushing
operations

## Performance Optimization Results

| Metric                                   | Before                | After                  | Improvement |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| **Base Image Pull**                      | 800MB (Ubuntu)        | 167MB (node-18:alpine) | -87% size   |
| **Base Image Pull time**                 | 20s (Ubuntu)          | 8s (node-18:alpine)    | -60% time   |
| **Pipeline time (test and build)**       | Full pipeline (85s )  | Full pipeline (57s )   | -33% time   |
| **Pipeline time (test, build, release)** | Full pipeline (115s ) | Full pipeline (86s )   | -25% time   |
| **Non relevant file Changes**            | Full pipeline (85s )  | Skip job (24s)         | -72% time   |

## Critical Technical Insights

- **Modular Pipeline Design** gitlab provides very simple mechanism to
  modularize the pipeline files into different templates and call them in one
  file by using `include:` to use templates, we can use `include:` in any number
  of files once per file to call any number templates from our own project or
  different project
  - **Split logic by concern**: Break down lint, build, test, and release into
    their own templates.
  - **Keep templates minimal**: Each template should handle a single concern to
    maximize clarity and reuse.

- **Explicit Sharing Between Jobs** Every job runs in its own fresh container
  which its own docker image, so variables, caches, and artifacts are **not
  passed automatically**. Always declare what needs to be passed, or jobs will
  waste time reinstalling or rebuilding dependencies.

- **Image Size Dominates Pipeline Speed:** network transfer time to pull the
  larger base image often exceeds job execution time
  - node-18:Alpine Linux vs Ubuntu: 87% size reduction
  - Lightweight images compound benefits in saving time across multiple jobs

- **Limits of `rules:changes`** GitLab’s built-in `rules:changes` relies
  internally on `git diff` between previous commit and current commit. It fails
  in API-triggered pipelines because GitLab sets the previous commit SHA to all
  zeros `00000000...`. For reliability, consider custom runtime script with
  `git diff` logic.

- **Compile-time vs Runtime Decisions** GitLab evaluates `rules` at **compile
  time**, while `script:` runs at **runtime**. This means job's condition
  involving `rules` can’t be influenced by script output. Use **downstream child
  pipelines** when runtime data must influence execution of subsequent jobs.

- **Nested Pipelines Made Easy** Unlike other CI/CD tools that need API calls,
  GitLab allows multi-level pipeline nesting (parent → child → grandchild)
  directly with the `trigger` keyword. This makes complex workflows
  straightforward to implement.

- **Parent/Child pipline Independence** Parent and child pipelines run
  independently, with separate job IDs by default not influencing each other's
  status. A child pipeline can fail while the parent pipeline still shows
  success. To synchronize results and reflect combined status, use
  `strategy: depend` under the parent pipeline's `trigger`.

## Best Practices and Recommendations

- **Measure and optimize job performance** — Always review job logs to
  understand execution time. This helps identify redundant steps (e.g.,
  repeatedly saving caches) and optimize resource-heavy processes, such as
  replacing large base images with lightweight ones.

- **Debug API requests locally with `curl`** — Before pushing changes to GitHub
  or running Actions, test your GitLab API requests using `curl` from the
  terminal. This allows faster debugging, quick experimentation with tokens,
  branch names, and payloads.

- **Explicitly pass data between jobs** — Never assume that variables,
  artifacts, or caches will be shared automatically. Each job runs in its own
  isolated container, so explicitly define what needs to be passed.

- **Use pipeline trigger tokens** — For API-triggered pipelines, rely on trigger
  tokens. They don’t require additional permissions and are purpose-built for
  securely starting pipelines.

- **Think “infrastructure as code”** — Treat `.gitlab-ci.yml` like code. Break
  logic into modular templates, group related tasks, and design conditional
  execution paths for cleaner pipelines.

- **Externalize complex scripts** — For long or multiline scripts, store them in
  separate files and invoke them within your pipeline (ensuring they have
  execute permissions). This improves readability and maintainability.

- **Leverage YAML anchors** — Reuse repetitive code with YAML anchors to keep
  pipelines DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

- **Use custom scripts when needed** — Remember that YAML pipelines ultimately
  run shell scripts under the hood. If native features fall short, define custom
  script-based solutions.

## Key Lessons Learned

- **Group related jobs together**: helps in conditionally running relevant
  multiple jobs together, avoid repeating same condition on multiple jobs,
  isolated different logic to different group as in the case of parent/child
  pipeline, decision logic -> parent pipeline and execution logic -> child
  pipeline. it helps in saving time, compute resources

- **CI/CD's Native Features Have Limits:** Don't assume built-in features work
  reliably in all scenarios. Always have a fallback strategy like defining our
  own custom script based solutions when native solutions doesn't work .

- **Performance Compounds with optimizations:** Small optimizations (lighter
  images, smarter caching, selective artifacts) add up to significant time
  savings while running pipelines when multiplied across many pipeline runs.

- **Modular Design Pays Dividends:** The upfront investment in creating modular
  templates pays off exponentially as codebase grow, due to the benefits of it
  reusability, readability, maintainability.

- **Test Your Edge Cases:** Manual triggers, API calls, tag pushes, and merge
  request pipelines can all behave differently. Test them all.

- **Observing job Logs is Essential:** When pipelines make dynamic decisions,
  job logs provide feedback about the error that guide us to better understand
  why actual behavior is not matching expected behavior and what decisions were
  made. This saves hours of debugging time.
