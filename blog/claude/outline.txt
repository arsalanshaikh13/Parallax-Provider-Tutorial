# üß© How I Built a Modular GitHub Actions Pipeline (Part 1: Architecture)
### TL;DR
## üí° Why Modular Workflows Matter
#### Folder Layout
## üèóÔ∏è Parent Workflow: The Orchestrator
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# A friendly, descriptive name for the workflow.
# Defines when the workflow will run.
# This is where the workflow's jobs are defined.
## üîÅ Reusable Workflows
# .github/workflows/filter-changes.yml
# A short and descriptive name for the workflow.
# This allows the workflow to be called and reused by other workflows.
# Defines the single job in this workflow.
# .github/workflows/test_and_build.yml
# A clear and descriptive name for the workflow.
# This defines the workflow as a reusable workflow that can be called by other workflows.
# The jobs section defines the work that will be performed by the workflow.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Composite Actions
# .github/actions/test_and_build/action.yml
# A clear name for the reusable workflow.
# Defines the inputs that this action accepts.
# Specifies that this is a composite run action, which combines multiple steps into a single reusable action.
## üß≠ Tradeoffs: Reusable vs Composite
