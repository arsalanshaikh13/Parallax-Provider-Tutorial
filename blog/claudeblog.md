# Building Production-Grade GitHub Actions Pipelines: A Complete Developer's Guide

## Introduction

After wrestling with a monolithic 100+ line GitHub Actions workflow that ran on
every change (including documentation updates), I rebuilt our entire CI/CD
pipeline using advanced modular patterns. This guide shares the architecture,
performance optimizations, and critical insights I discovered along the way.

**What You'll Learn:**

- How to build modular, reusable GitHub Actions pipelines
- Advanced techniques for change detection, caching, and secret management
- Performance optimizations that reduced our pipeline time by 47%
- Production-ready patterns used by enterprise teams

## The Problem: When Monolithic Workflows Break Down

### Initial State

```yaml
# What we started with - the monolithic approach
name: Everything Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # 100+ steps doing everything
      # No conditional execution
      # Poor caching strategy
      # No modular components
```

**Pain Points:**

- Pipeline ran for documentation changes (wasted compute)
- 17-second dependency installation every time
- No test coverage visibility during code review
- Debugging failures in a massive YAML file was nightmare
- Impossible to reuse logic across projects

### Component Responsibilities

| Component              | Purpose                                                                                                             | Benefit                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Parent Workflow**    | Orchestrates execution and change detection of relevant files                                                       | Run workflows on relevant file changes   |
| **Reusable Workflows** | Clean separation of concerns; isolated, testable pipeline stages                                                    | Consistent and easier reuse across repos |
| **Composite Actions**  | Share repeatable step blocks (e.g., checkout, Node setup, cache storing/retrieving, test, build, artifact handling) | Reduced duplication                      |

## Implementation Deep Dive

### 1. Change Detection in the files

**Problem**: GitHub's native `paths` filter works fine on normal pushes but not
reliable on force pushes, rollbacks, and rebases.

**Solution**: Custom git diff with explicit commit comparison:

```yaml
# normally try this solution initially to detect changes it will work fine on normal pushes but on rollbacks, rebases, resets it may or may not work reliably
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - '**.json'
      - '**.js'
      - '**/package.json'
      - '**/yarn.lock'
      - '**.*rc'
      - '**.yml'
# then alternatively try this solution which will reliably work on any solution
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  # call the reusable workflow in ci.yml
  filter-changes:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/filter-changes.yml

# .github/workflows/filter-changes.yml
# A short and descriptive name for the Reusable workflow.
name: Filter Changes
# This allows the workflow to be called and reused by other workflows.
on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      # Defines a descriptive output to check if relevant files were changed.
      has_relevant_changes:
        description: 'Check whether relevant files changed'
        value: ${{ jobs.filter-changes.outputs.has_relevant_changes }}

# Defines the single job in this workflow.
jobs:
  filter-changes:
    # Specifies the type of runner the job will use.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      # Sets the output value for this job, which is the result from the 'check-changes' step.
      has_relevant_changes: ${{ steps.check-changes.outputs.has_changes }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        # Uses the 'actions/checkout' action to get a copy of the repository's code.
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # fetch current and previous / parent commit which is needed for comparison
          fetch-depth: 2

      - name: Check for relevant file changes
        # Assigns an ID to this step so its output can be referenced later.
        id: check-changes
        run: |
          # The 'set +e' command prevents the script from exiting immediately if a command fails.
          set +e
          # Uses 'git diff' to find the names of files that have changed between the current and previous commit.
          # The output is piped to 'grep' to filter for specific file extensions like .js, .json, etc.
          changed_files=$(git diff --name-only  HEAD^ ${{ github.sha }} 2>&1 | grep -E '\.js$|\.json$|\.yml$|\.lock$|\..*rc$')
          echo $changed_files output
          # An 'if' condition checks if the 'changed_files' variable is not empty.
          if [ -n "$changed_files" ]; then
            echo "Relevant files have been changed."
            # Sets the 'has_changes' output to 'true' if changes are found.
            echo "has_changes=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "No relevant files were changed. Skipping subsequent jobs."
            # Sets the 'has_changes' output to 'false' if no relevant changes are found.
            echo "has_changes=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
```

**Why the alternate solution Works:**

- **Explicit commit comparison** handles all git scenarios (rollbacks, force
  pushes, rebases)
- **fetch-depth: 2** ensures we always have the parent commit
- **Targeted file filtering** focuses on files that actually affect builds
- **Performance impact**: 80% reduction in unnecessary job runs

### 2. Advanced Caching Strategy: From 110MB to 17MB

**The Problem with Yarn Cache:** Even with Yarn's global cache, you still need
to:

- Install dependencies (package resolution) which Links dependencies to specific
  Node.js versions

**The node_modules Solution:**

```yaml
# .github/actions/test_and_build/action.yml

# This step checks for a cached 'node_modules' directory to speed up the workflow.
- name: Get node_modules
  # The 'actions/cache' action handles caching and restoring files.
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  id: node_modules
  with:
    # The path to the directory that will be cached.
    path: |
      **/node_modules
    # The cache key is generated from the runner's OS, a fixed string, and a hash of the 'yarn.lock' file and node version used.
    # This ensures the cache is unique to the dependencies and the runner environment.
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node_modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}-v18.20.8

# This step only runs if the cache was not found in the previous step.
- name: Setup Node.js
  if: steps.node_modules.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
  # Uses the 'actions/setup-node' action to set up the specified Node.js version.
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 18.20.8

# This step installs the project dependencies using yarn.
# It also only runs if the cache was not found, as there's no need to install if the cache is restored.
- name: Install dependencies
  if: steps.node_modules.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
  run: yarn install  --frozen-lockfile
  shell: bash
```

**Why this Works:**

- the actions/cache saves and restore the node modules cache
- the setup node and installing dependencies steps only run when the cache is
  not found **Performance Results:**

- **Cache size**: 110MB → 17MB (85% reduction)
- **Install time**: 17s → 9s (47% improvement) as install step is completely
  skipped
- **Deterministic restoration**: No package resolution overhead and linking
  dependencies

### 3. The Secret Passing Chain: Understanding GitHub Actions Security

**Critical Insight**: GitHub Actions has strict security isolation:

- Reusable workflows DON'T inherit secrets from callers
- Composite actions NEVER see secrets implicitly
- All secret passing must be explicit

**Implementation Pattern:**

```yaml
# Parent workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
jobs:
# This job runs tests and builds the project.
  test-and-build:
    # Reuses a separate workflow file for the test and build logic.
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test_and_build.yml
    # passing the secrets into reusable workflow
    secrets:
      secret_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}

# Reusable workflow (.github/workflows/test-build.yml)
name: Lint, Test, and Build

# This defines the workflow as a reusable workflow that can be called by other workflows.
on:
  workflow_call:
    # Specifies the secrets that must be passed in when this workflow is called.
    secrets:
      secret_GITHUB_TOKEN:
        required: true

jobs:
  test-build:
    - name: Setup, install, lint, test and build code
      # This step calls a custom composite action located in the local repository.
      # This promotes code reuse and keeps the main workflow file clean.
      uses: ./.github/actions/test_and_build
      with:
        # Passes the required secret to the reusable action.
        secret_input_github_token: ${{secrets.secret_GITHUB_TOKEN}}

# Composite action (.github/actions/test_and_build/action.yml)
# Defines the inputs that this action accepts.
inputs:
  secret_input_github_token:
    required: true

# Specifies that this is a composite run action, which combines multiple steps into a single reusable action.
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
      # This action generates a code coverage report and adds it as a comment on the pull request.
    - name: Generate coverage report
      uses: ArtiomTr/jest-coverage-report-action@v2
      with:
        github-token: ${{ inputs.secret_input_github_token }}
```

### 4. Output Flow: From Steps in reusable workflow to Conditional Execution of job in parent caller workflow

In order to get the output from the reusable workflow to run the job
conditionally in parent caller workflow we have to follow:

- **The Chain**: Step Output → Job Output → Workflow Output → Parent Conditional

```yaml
# .github/workflows/filter-changes.yml

# Step level
- id: check-changes
  run: echo "has_changes=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

# Job level
jobs:
  filter-changes:
    outputs:
      has_relevant_changes: ${{ steps.check-changes.outputs.has_changes }}

# Workflow level
on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      has_relevant_changes:
        value: ${{ jobs.filter-changes.outputs.has_relevant_changes }}

# Parent conditional execution (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
jobs:
  test-and-build:
    needs: filter-changes
    if: needs.filter-changes.outputs.has_relevant_changes == 'true'
```

### 5. Artifact Management: Efficient Job-to-Job Data Transfer

```yaml
# Producer job
- name: Upload build artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-${{ github.sha }}
    path: |
      dist/**
    if-no-files-found: error
    retention-days: 30

# Consumer job
- name: Download build artifacts (dist/)
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: dist
    path: dist/
```

> these are just the some important snippets from the code for full code review

> https://github.com/arsalanshaikh13/Parallax-Provider-Tutorial/tree/main/.github/workflows

**Best Practices:**

- Use unique artifact names (`build-${{ github.sha }}`)
- Set appropriate retention periods
- Include all necessary files for downstream jobs

### Developer Experience Enhancements

- **Automated coverage reports** in pull requests
- **Immediate feedback** for non-code changes
- **Clear pipeline status** with descriptive job names
- **Protected branches** with required status checks

## Critical Insights & Lessons Learned

### 1. GitHub Actions Security Model

**Key Learning**: Security isolation is by design, not by accident.

- Explicit permission declaration at every level
- Secret passing must be intentional and documented
- Minimal required permissions principle

### 2. Performance Optimization Strategies

**Critical Insight**: Measure before optimizing.

- node_modules caching beats global package caches for deterministic builds
- Change detection saves more resources than any other optimization
- Cache key strategy directly impacts hit rates

### 3. Architecture Decision Framework

**Decision Process**: Always ask "What problem does this solve?"

- **Modular design** → Maintainability and reusability
- **Explicit communication** → Security and predictability
- **Conditional execution** → Performance and cost optimization

### Common Issues and Root Causes

| Error                    | Root Cause                              | Solution                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `secrets.X not found`    | Composite actions don't inherit secrets | Pass via inputs explicitly                     |
| Coverage not in PR       | Missing write permissions               | Add `permissions:` to caller workflow          |
| Change detection fails   | Shallow clone issues                    | Use `fetch-depth: 2`                           |
| Tag push rollback issues | Git tag references persist              | Force reset → push previous → new commit + tag |

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### Architectural Guidelines

1. **Modularize Early**: Start with reusable components from day one
2. **Be Explicit**: Never rely on implicit behavior for secrets/permissions
3. **Measure Impact**: Quantify optimizations with real metrics
4. **Guard Quality**: Use required status checks on protected branches

### Performance Optimization

1. **Cache Strategy**: Choose caching approach based on your dependency
   management
2. **Change Detection**: Implement smart filtering for relevant files
3. **Parallel Execution**: Use job dependencies strategically
4. **Resource Management**: Set appropriate artifact retention periods

### Security Considerations

1. **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only what each component needs
2. **Explicit Secret Flow**: Document and validate secret passing chains
3. **Regular Audits**: Review permissions and access patterns periodically
