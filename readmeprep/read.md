I can help you create a comprehensive README file for a GitHub repository that
addresses all the points you've outlined. The README will be structured to
provide a clear overview, detailed implementation specifics, and best practices
for a modular CircleCI configuration.

## **Parallax Provider: A Modular CircleCI Workflow**

### **Overview**

This project demonstrates a robust and scalable CI/CD pipeline built with
CircleCI. It utilizes a modular approach to configuration, dynamic pipeline
generation, and intelligent caching to optimize build times and enhance
security. The core of this setup is a dynamic preprocessor script that assembles
individual job configurations into a single, cohesive `config.yml` file,
addressing the limitations of CircleCI's static alphabetical ordering.

---

### **Goals**

- **Modularize Configuration:** Break down the monolithic `config.yml` into
  smaller, manageable files for different jobs and workflows.
- **Dynamically packing modular files:** Use a preprocessor script
  (`preprocessor.sh`) to dynamically pack modular code into a single
  configuration file in the correct order.
- **Conditional Execution:** Control pipeline and workflow execution based on
  specific conditions like branch pushes, Git tags, and API triggers from GitHub
  Actions.
- **Optimize Performance:** Implement effective caching strategies for
  dependencies (e.g., `node_modules`) and utilize lightweight Docker images to
  speed up pipeline execution.
- **Efficient Artifact Management:** Use `persist_to_workspace` and
  `attach_workspace` to share artifacts and dependencies between jobs, avoiding
  redundant work.
- **Secure Credential Management:** Store and access sensitive information and
  tokens via CircleCI's environment variables and contexts.
- **Inter-Pipeline Communication:** Pass parameters between parent and child
  pipelines to enable complex, multi-stage workflows.

---

### **What I Implemented**

- **Preprocessor Script (`preprocessor.sh`):** A custom shell script that reads
  a list of modular YAML files, concatenates them in a specified order, and
  outputs a final `config.yml`. This script runs as the first step of the
  pipeline.
- **Dynamic Config Generation:** The `config.yml` is generated at runtime,
  allowing the pipeline to be triggered dynamically. This bypasses CircleCI's
  alphabetical loading order and ensures dependencies are correctly defined.
- **Conditional Logic:**
  - **Pipeline Generation:** The `path-filtering/filter` orb is used to
    conditionally generate a child pipeline only when specific files are
    changed.
  - **Workflow Execution:** Workflows are conditionally executed using `unless`
    or `when` clauses based on branch names, tag patterns
    (`only: /^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+/`), and environment variables (e.g.,
    `CCI_TRIGGER_SOURCE` for API triggers).
- **Workspace Management:**
  - After the preprocessor, the generated `config.yml` and any other required
    files are persisted to the workspace using `persist_to_workspace`.
  - Dependent jobs then use `attach_workspace` to access these files, ensuring
    they have the correct configuration and artifacts.
- **Caching Strategy:**
  - **Cache:** `save_cache` and `restore_cache` are used to store and retrieve
    dependencies like `node_modules`. A cache key based on the `yarn.lock` file
    ensures the cache is only updated when dependencies change. This is ideal
    for independent jobs.
  - **Workspaces:** `persist_to_workspace` is used to share artifacts and
    dependencies between jobs within the same workflow, especially when a job
    depends on the output of a previous job (e.g., `yarn install`).
- **Parameter Passing:** The `pipeline.continue` API endpoint is used to trigger
  a child pipeline from a parent pipeline, passing parameters in the API call
  body to control jobs in the child pipeline.

---

### **Problems Encountered (Summary)**

- CircleCI's default alphabetical config file loading prevents modular files
  from being loaded in the correct dependency order.
- `path-filtering/filter` requires a `tag` filter on the generating job if the
  dependent job has one, otherwise the workflow won't be generated.
- Getting caching strategies right between `save_cache`/`restore_cache` and
  `persist_to_workspace` to optimize for both independent and dependent jobs.
- Conditionally running workflows on multiple conditions (e.g., tags and API
  triggers) was complex and required careful use of regex

---

### **Deep Root-Cause Analysis**

CircleCI's `config.yml` is parsed as a single unit. When using reusable
commands, jobs, and orbs, the order of definition doesn't matter, but when the
configuration itself needs to be assembled from multiple files, the standard
approach falls short. The `preprocessor.sh` script solves this by running before
CircleCI's parser, creating a single, well-ordered `config.yml` on the fly. The
issue with `path-filtering` and tags arises because a downstream job's filters
can only be evaluated if the upstream job (which generates the config) has
already met those same conditions.

---

### **Fixes (What I Changed, Why)**

- **Preprocessor Script:** Implemented a `preprocessor.sh` that explicitly
  orders the files to be included in the final `config.yml`. This ensures that
  jobs, commands, and orbs are defined before they are referenced.
- **Filter Logic:** Ensured that any job that generates a new config via
  `path-filtering/filter` also includes the same `tag` filter as the dependent
  jobs. This guarantees that the parent job runs and generates the config only
  when a tag is pushed, allowing the child jobs with tag filters to be evaluated
  correctly.
- **Caching Strategy:** Created a clear distinction:
  - **`persist_to_workspace`:** For jobs that have a direct dependency on a
    preceding job within the same workflow (e.g., `install-dependencies` -\>
    `test`).
  - **`save_cache`:** For jobs that are largely independent but need to restore
    a common set of dependencies, like `node_modules` for a build and a test job
    running in separate, parallel workflows.
- **Conditional Triggers:** Used a combination of CircleCI's built-in branch/tag
  filters and checking the `CCI_TRIGGER_SOURCE` environment variable to create
  precise conditional logic.

### **Example Config Snippets**

```yaml
# preprocessor.sh (snippet)
#!/bin/bash
cat jobs/install.yml >> .circleci/config.yml
cat jobs/build.yml >> .circleci/config.yml

# config.yml (snippet showing path-filtering and tag filters)
workflows:
  build-and-test:
    jobs:
      - path-filtering/filter:
          name: trigger-child-pipeline
          base-revision: master
          config-path: .circleci/child-config.yml
          mapping: |
            src/frontend/.* frontend-app
            src/backend/.* backend-app
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^v.*/

      - install:
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^v.*/

# a dependent job must have the same tag filter
# as the job that generated the config
```

---

### **Debug Checklist / Commands**

- **Check Preprocessor Output:** `cat .circleci/config.yml` to ensure the final
  config is structured correctly.
- **Verify Environment Variables:** `echo $CIRCLE_TAG`,
  `echo $CCI_TRIGGER_SOURCE` to confirm the correct variables are being passed.
- **Simulate Filters:** Manually run a job with the `--parameter` flag to test
  conditional logic without pushing code.
- **Check Workspaces:** After `persist_to_workspace`, check the workspace
  directory to ensure files are present.

---

### **Best Practices & Recommendations**

- **Filters:** If a dependent job has a filter, the job that generates its
  configuration must also have the same filter. Otherwise, the workflow won't be
  generated.
- **Caching:** Use `persist_to_workspace` for dependent jobs in a sequence. Use
  `save_cache` and `restore_cache` for independent jobs to avoid redundant
  installations.
- **Lock Dependencies:** Always use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` or `npm ci`
  to ensure strict adherence to your lock file, preventing inconsistent builds.
- **Docker Images:** Use lightweight Docker images (e.g., `alpine` versions) to
  reduce build times.
- **Shell Scripts:** Always make shell scripts executable
  (`chmod +x script.sh`).
- **Security:** Store sensitive data in CircleCI contexts or environment
  variables. Access information like branch names and tags using built-in
  environment variables (`$CIRCLE_BRANCH`, `$CIRCLE_TAG`).

### **Impact of the Fixes**

The implemented changes result in a highly flexible, performant, and secure
CI/CD pipeline. Build times are significantly reduced due to effective caching
and dependency management. The modular configuration is easy to maintain and
scale. By controlling pipeline execution, we avoid unnecessary builds, saving
credits and providing a clear, auditable workflow.

### **Repro & Support Notes**

If an issue arises, first check the output of the preprocessor script to confirm
the `config.yml` is valid. Next, review the `path-filtering` job's logs to
ensure it's generating the child config as expected. For tag-related issues,
verify that the `tag` filters are consistent across all relevant jobs and
workflows.
